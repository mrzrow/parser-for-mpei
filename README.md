# parser-for-mpei

I made a simple parser for students who want to study at MPEI (МЭИ: https://mpei.ru/Pages/default.aspx).
You just need to enter your SNILS (СНИЛС) and webpages that contain all applicants in your group (from this website: https://pk.mpei.ru/inform/list.html).

The programm will show you your rate and your rate considering people who agreed.
